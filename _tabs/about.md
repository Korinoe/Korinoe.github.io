Hi, I'm Corinna [she/her] :seedling:

I recently graduated from Drexel University. In attempt to continue learning I wanted to write about the things I learn post-grad from projects I pick up, along-side pursing a career in the tech industry as a Software Engineer. I currently work at Wells Fargo as an Engineering Associate in New York, NY.

## Background
I am a Chinese-Vietnamese American, who spent most of my formative years in north Philadelphia, PA. I come from a low-income background and am the first person in my family to pursue higher education. I went to Central High School (information that only matters if you're from Philly :sunglasses:). I attended Drexel University in 2017 to 2022. I did the five year program that allowed me to do three six-month long full-time internships to get hands on experience and learn about different jobs relating to software engineering. I studied Computer Science with a conentration in Human-Computer Interation and Software Engineering.
## Education
B.S., in Computer Science, 2022, Drexel University :dragon:  
B.A., 2017 (276 :sparkles:), Central High School, Philadephia, PA

We also held weekly informational presentations with Drexel's student organization **Womenâ€™s Empowerment**.

## Interests
I love continously trying new things! Throughout my life so far, I've picked up: crocheting, painting, art, cooking, programming, [vlogging](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8XVSjZyQP3jKumJoW8DNQg/featured), thrifting, living sustainability, etc..
