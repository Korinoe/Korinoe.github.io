Personalizing my desktop and mac environment makes my life just a little more enjoyable :relieved:  
As of 2022, this is what I have customized (Note: a common theme is the color pink):

## Terminal
Edit the .zshrc file for a "welcome banner" on boot. Preferences to make a pink and black theme.

## Spotify
I use [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) to make my Spotify GUI pink, using the [Ziro Theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/blob/master/THEMES.md#ziro) in Rose Pine.

## Desktop Folders
On MacOS, [folder icons can be changed](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-icons-for-files-or-folders-on-mac-mchlp2313/mac#:~:text=the%20menu%20bar.-,Select%20the%20file%20or%20folder%20whose%20icon%20you%20want%20to,Paste%20in%20the%20menu%20bar.) to an image of your choice. I'm currently using various transparent images of flowers.

## VS Code
Visual Studio Code is my text editor of choice. Their website has instructions on [how to apply themes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes). I personally like the [Pink-Cat-Boo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ftsamoyed.theme-pink-cat-boo) theme.
